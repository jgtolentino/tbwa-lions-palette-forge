## The Script

### OPEN — The Problem (0:00–0:15)

*[Pause. Look at the room.]*

> "Every year, thousands of campaigns launch.
> Most disappear.
> A few become case studies.
> And a handful... change culture."

*[Beat.]*

> "The difference isn't budget. It's not timing. It's not even talent."

> "It's **pattern recognition** — knowing what works before you make it."

---

### TURN — The Insight (0:15–0:30)

> "For decades, that instinct lived in the heads of a few legendary creatives.
> Unrepeatable. Unteachable. Unscalable."

*[Slight smile.]*

> "Until now."

---

### REVEAL — The Platform (0:30–0:45)

> "We built an AI that studied every Cannes Lion winner.
> Every effectiveness case. Every emotional beat that moved people."

> "Not to replace creative directors —
> but to give every creative director... **a photographic memory of greatness.**"

*[Gesture toward screen.]*

> "This is Ask CES.
> The first AI that thinks in **creative effectiveness** — not just efficiency."

---

### CLOSE — The Invitation (0:45–1:00)

> "It won't write your campaign.
> It will tell you **why your campaign will win.**"

*[Final pause.]*

> "We didn't build a tool.
> We built **the creative intuition your entire team deserves.**"

*[Nod.]*

> "Let me show you."
