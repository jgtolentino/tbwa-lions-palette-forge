### The AI That Thinks Like a Creative Director

---

## The Problem

Every agency has the same challenge:

> **Great creative instinct is rare, unteachable, and doesn't scale.**

Junior teams guess. Senior teams are overbooked.
And the patterns that separate good work from great work stay locked in a few legendary heads.

---

## The Solution

**Ask CES** is an AI-powered creative intelligence platform that gives every team member access to:

- **Pattern recognition** from 20+ years of Cannes Lions winners
- **Real-time campaign analysis** with emotional arc mapping
- **Strategic recommendations** grounded in effectiveness research
- **Competitive intelligence** across categories and markets

## What It Does

| Capability | What You Get |
|------------|--------------|
| **Video Analysis** | Scene-by-scene breakdown, emotional curves, pacing insights |
| **Ask CES Chat** | Strategic Q&A powered by effectiveness frameworks |
| **Campaign Dashboard** | Portfolio-level view of creative signals |
| **Competitive Intel** | Benchmark against category and cultural moments |

---

## Who It's For

- **Creative Directors** — Validate instincts with evidence
- **Strategists** — Turn briefs into effectiveness hypotheses

---

## The Difference

| Traditional Tools | Ask CES |

| Focus on media metrics | Focus on creative mechanics |
| Generic AI outputs | Strategy-native intelligence |
| Replace human judgment | Amplify human judgment |

## Sample Insight

**Input:** 60-second campaign spot (YouTube URL)

**Output:**
> "Emotional salience peaks at 0:22 but drops sharply before product reveal. Consider extending the tension beat by 3–5 seconds. Comparable structure to Cannes Grand Prix 2019 (Film)."
