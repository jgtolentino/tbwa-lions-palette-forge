# The Demo Script

## Click-by-Click Walkthrough with Talk Track

**Total runtime:** 3–5 minutes
**Best for:** Live client demo, internal buy-in, new business theater

---

## Pre-Demo Setup

- Browser open to Ask CES dashboard
- YouTube link ready (use a recent, well-known campaign spot)
- Screen sharing enabled
- **Do NOT** start on the login screen — start already inside

---

## ACT 1: The Dashboard (30 seconds)

### CLICK: Land on Campaign Intelligence Dashboard

**SAY:**
> "This is your command center.
> Every campaign, every insight, every pattern — in one place.
> But let me show you where it gets interesting."

*[Hover over metrics cards]*

> "These aren't vanity metrics.
> These are **creative effectiveness signals** — the kind that predict Lions, not just likes."

---

## ACT 2: The Ask (45 seconds)

### CLICK: Navigate to Ask CES Chat

**SAY:**
> "This is Ask CES — your strategic thinking partner.
> It's not a chatbot. It doesn't write copy.
> It **thinks with you** about what makes work actually work."

### TYPE:
```
What made the Apple "1984" ad so effective?
```

*[Wait for response]*

**SAY:**
> "Notice — it's not giving you a Wikipedia summary.
> It's giving you **the strategic mechanics**: disruption, cultural tension, earned media architecture.
> This is the kind of analysis that used to take a planner a week. Now it takes 4 seconds."

---

## ACT 3: The Magic Moment (90 seconds)

### CLICK: Navigate to Video Campaign Analysis

**SAY:**
> "Now here's where it gets powerful.
> Let's analyze a real campaign — live."

### ACTION: Paste YouTube URL of a recent campaign spot

**SAY:**
> "I'm dropping in [Brand X]'s latest spot.
> Watch what happens."

*[Wait for analysis to complete — 5-10 seconds]*

### REVEAL: Scene breakdown appears

**SAY:**
> "It just broke down the entire video — scene by scene.
> Emotional arc. Pacing. Brand presence. Audio-visual sync."

*[Scroll through insights]*

> "Look at this: it identified that **emotional salience drops after scene 8**.
> That's not a guess — that's pattern-matched against thousands of effectiveness cases."

### POINT TO: Recommendations section

**SAY:**
> "And here — strategic recommendations.
> Not 'add more logo.' Actual creative direction:
> *'Consider extending the emotional peak before the product reveal.'*"

*[Pause for effect]*

> "This is what it feels like to have the entire Cannes archive **thinking alongside you.**"

---

## ACT 4: The Close (30 seconds)

**SAY:**
> "So — to recap:
> - Real-time campaign analysis
> - Effectiveness prediction, not just performance tracking
> - Strategic recommendations, not just data dumps
>
> And all of it built on the same frameworks that define Cannes-winning work."

*[Look at audience]*

> "This isn't about replacing creative judgment.
> It's about **arming it.**"

> "Questions?"

## Emergency Fallbacks

| If This Happens | Say This |
|-----------------|----------|
| Analysis takes too long | "It's running deep analysis — this is the difference between fast and *thorough*." |
| Error message appears | "Let me refresh — even AI needs a coffee break." (Then switch to backup video) |
| Someone asks "Is this real?" | "Every insight is grounded in real effectiveness research. Want to see the methodology?" |
| "Can it write copy?" | "No — and that's the point. This is strategy, not execution. It makes *you* better." |
