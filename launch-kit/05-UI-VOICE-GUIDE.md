# UI Voice Guide

## Interface Copy That Sounds Like Strategy

**For:** TBWA Lions Palette Forge / Ask CES
**Principle:** Every word should feel like it came from a CCO, not a chatbot.

---

## Voice Principles

### 1. Confident, Not Arrogant
Write like someone who's been in the room when Lions were won.
Not someone who read about it.

### 2. Strategic, Not Technical
Users don't care about "natural language processing."
They care about "understanding what makes work work."

### 3. Precise, Not Verbose
Every word earns its place.
If it doesn't add meaning, cut it.

### 4. Warm Expert, Not Cold Robot
The tone is a brilliant colleague — not a help desk.

Rewrite: "Ask me anything about what makes work work..."
```

**Welcome Message:**
```
Current: "Hello! How can I help you today?"

Rewrite: "Welcome back. I've been studying what wins — let's put that to work for you. What's on your mind?"
```

**Thinking State:**
```
Current: "Generating response..."

Rewrite: "Pulling from 20 years of Lions winners..."
```

---

### Insight Cards — Headers

| Current | Rewrite |
|---------|---------|
| Emotional Analysis | Emotional Arc |
| Scene Breakdown | The Beats |
| Recommendations | What I'd Change |
| Performance Metrics | Effectiveness Signals |
| Competitive Analysis | How You Stack Up |
| Brand Presence | Where the Brand Lives |

---

### Insight Cards — Tone Examples

**Before:**
> "The video shows high emotional engagement in the first 15 seconds, with a notable decline in the middle section."

**After:**
> "You hook them in the first 15 seconds — then lose them. The middle sags. Consider tightening the narrative bridge."

---

**Before:**
> "Brand logo appears 3 times with an average screen time of 2.1 seconds."

**After:**
> "The brand shows up 3 times, but never owns the frame. It's present — not dominant."

---

**Before:**
> "Recommendation: Increase emotional intensity before product reveal."

**After:**
> "The product reveal lands flat because the emotional runway is too short. Extend the tension — let it breathe."

---

### Error Messages

| Current | Rewrite |
|---------|---------|
| "Error 500: Server error" | "Something broke on our end. Give us a second." |
| "Invalid URL" | "That link didn't work — try a YouTube or Vimeo URL." |
| "Analysis failed" | "Couldn't crack that one. Try a different file or link." |
| "Network error" | "Lost the connection. Check your network and try again." |

---

### Success Messages

| Current | Rewrite |
|---------|---------|
| "Upload complete" | "Got it. Analyzing now..." |
| "Analysis ready" | "Done. Here's what I found." |
| "Report generated" | "Your story is ready. Take a look." |
| "Copied to clipboard" | "Copied. Paste wherever you need it." |

---

## Headline Formulas

For dashboard cards, use this structure:

**[Observation] — [So What]**

Examples:
> "Emotional peak at 0:22 — but the payoff comes too late."

> "Strong open, weak middle — the story sags before it lands."

> "Brand presence is high — but it never earns attention."

---

## Words to Avoid

| Don't Say | Say Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| Utilize | Use |
| Leverage | Use / Build on |
| Synergy | Connection |
| Optimize | Improve / Sharpen |
| Actionable insights | What to do next |
| Best practices | What works |
| Learnings | Lessons / Takeaways |
| Circle back | Follow up |

---

## Words to Embrace

- Tension
- Arc
- Beat
- Signal
- Pattern
- Effectiveness
- Land (as in "the message lands")
- Breathe (as in "let it breathe")
- Earn (as in "earn attention")
- Own (as in "own the frame")

## Sample Full-Screen Rewrite

### Video Analysis — Results Header

**Before:**
> Video Analysis Complete
> Your video has been analyzed. Below are the results.

**After:**
> Here's What I Found
> The beats, the patterns, and what it all means.

---

## Implementation Notes

1. These rewrites can be applied incrementally — start with headers and empty states
2. Tone should stay consistent even when features are incomplete
3. Never use exclamation points in error messages
4. Loading states are an opportunity to build trust — make them feel human
